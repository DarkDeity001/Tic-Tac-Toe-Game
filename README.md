This is the Old and Classic game named Tic Tac Toe which was played by us when we were child. The game is made using HTML ,CSS and Javascript
<br>
<p><b>NOTE:-</b> This is not the main project , I made while learning javascript, hence whatever will be my main project you'll find "main project" written in the readme file.<br>
If there is no main project written anywhere in the readme file then that file is just a trial project or project which i made just to know the concept properly.
